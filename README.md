### Spyware and Repression

This repository contains code and data for a short paper on the association between spyware and mass repression. 

The main code and outputs for analysis are in `analysis.ipynb`, which can be opened as a jupyter notebook or in any code editor. 
The requirements for the project are specified in the `ds.yml` file, and the two main datasets used are in the data directory. 

When running the python notebook, please make sure the filenames match the argument strings given to pandas when creating the initial dataframes. 

Thank you!
